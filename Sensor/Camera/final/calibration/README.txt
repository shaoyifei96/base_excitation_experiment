These are the default calibration photos for the camera that was supplied. If you want to use a different camera:

1) Move/Delete all the pictures from this folder.
2) Take anywhere from 20 to 30 pictures of the calibration image. (In the directory calibrate)
3) Ensure that the images have the file extension .jpg and put them in this folder.
4) Rerun the calibration script "calibration.py". It will replace all the necessary files with updated data from the new calibration.
